# Mastermind-Game

The MasterMind Game is a classic code-breaking game that requires the player to guess a randomly generated code consisting of a certain number of digits. The objective of the game is to break the code within a limited number of attempts by guessing the correct digits in the correct positions.

The MasterMind Game project provided above is a C program that allows the user to play the game in a console environment. The program uses a combination of loops, functions, and user input to create an interactive game experience.

At the start of the game, the user is presented with a welcome message and prompted to enter the number of guesses they want to make. The user is also asked to choose the number of digits in the code they want to break, which can be between 1 to 3 digits.

The program then generates a random code consisting of the chosen number of digits, which the user must try to guess. If the user wants, they can choose to change the randomly generated code by answering a prompt.

The user then enters their guesses, and the program provides feedback on the accuracy of their guesses. The feedback consists of two numbers, the number of correct guesses at the correct position and the number of correct guesses at the wrong position. The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the code correctly. If the user is unable to guess the code within the allowed number of attempts, the game ends, and the user loses.

If the user is able to guess the code correctly, they win the game. The program then displays a congratulatory message and prompts the user to play again or quit. The user can choose to play again and try to break a new code.

Overall, the MasterMind Game project is a fun and interactive way to challenge your problem-solving skills and test your luck. The program's use of functions and loops makes it easy to understand and modify, making it an excellent project for beginners learning the C programming language.
